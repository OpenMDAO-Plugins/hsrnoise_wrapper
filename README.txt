OpenMDAO component wrapper for HSRNoise.  HSRNoise was developed during the High Speed Research (HSR) program and is suitable for predicting aircraft noise of supersonic commercial aircraft.  HSRNoise also contains two noise models for predicting noise from mixer-ejector nozzles.  This wrapper is specific to running the modules for predicting noise from mixer-ejector nozzles.  Note, this wrapper uses geometry and flow variable trees to ease passing of information to DREA.
